#summary How to install and build FLCore.

 * You need Java (probably 1.5 or 1.6, I just download the latest [http://eclipse.org Eclipse]).
 * You need OpenGL
 * You need Windows, Linux, or OS X -- but we have only tested recently on Windows

== OS X ==

Create a "build.properties" with the following entries:
{{{
jogl.platform=macosx-universal
sdljava.platform=
}}}

== Windows ==

If SDL 1.2 is not installed, you will have to unzip the `SDL` zip file (downloaded for your convenience after the "get-dependencies" step below) and install it. Usually this is just a manner of copying the `SDL.dll` file to the `\Windows` directory.

== Building ==

Run Ant file "build.xml" with target "get-dependencies". This will download and unzip libraries to the "lib" directory.

If using Eclipse, refresh the project to build. If not, run Ant target "jar" to compile source and make the `FLCore.jar` file.
