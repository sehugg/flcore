
To build under Win32:

* Create DLL project

* Turn off precompiled headers in "Project/Settings/C++..."

* Add .cpp & .h files

* Add include paths to com/fasterlight/sdl/native directory, 
  and to SDL include dir,
  and to dirs containing jni.h and jni_md.h

* build

* Follow SDL directions for copying .lib files into dir, add to project

* Put JSDL.dll in same directory as SDL.dll (windows\system?)

* Of course, compile .java files

Sorry I don't have more detail, but it was just about that easy!!
